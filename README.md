  Wind power is recognized as an ideal renewable energy source. While alleviating the existing energy crisis, it can also reduce environmental pollution caused by fossil fuels. Accurate and stable wind speed prediction is essential for the effective management of wind farms and energy systems. However, due to the inherent random nonlinear fluctuation characteristics of wind speed changes, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory forecast results. Taking into account the poor prediction performance of traditional statistical methods, this article aims to combine neural network models, especially deep learning models, with data preprocessing techniques to improve wind speed prediction accuracy.
 **Introduction**
This paper includes EMD data preprocessing technology, deep learning LSTM time series prediction code and traditional neural network prediction code.
